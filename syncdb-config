r_user=myusername
r_host=ftp.mywebsite.com
r_cert=~/.ssh/wordpress.pem
r_web_dir=public_html
r_port= # usually left blank

l_web_addr=dev.mywebsite.com
r_web_addr=mywebsite.com
r_web_addr_alt= # usually left blank (see note below)


    # $r_user is your FTP username. It is used to ssh into your site: `ssh
    # $r_user@ftp.mywebsite.com`.

    # $r_host is your FTP hostname. It is used to ssh into your site: `ssh
    # myusername@$r_host`.

    # $r_web_dir is the directory in which your remote site is located (relative to
    # the user root). It's usually public_html, www, www/mywebsite.com/public_html
    # etc...).

    # $r_port is an optional field specifying the port number to use. In most cases
    # this can remain blank, although Host Gator for example requires port 22 to
    # connect via SSH.

    # $l_web_addr is whatever you set your local server name to. Something like
    # localhost:8888/mywebsite or dev.mywebsite.com or mywebsite.dev. We'll be
    # search and replacing this string later on.

    # $r_web_addr is the web address, or site URL of your site. It is used to
    # search and replace your database.
    #
    # $r_web_addr_alt is for those who, rather than running site pairs, run
    # triplets: local, dev, and production/live. $r_web_addr_alt is a slot for
    # another search string. If you set this variable, the Search and Replace
    # function will prompt you each time to ask which remote site you are trying to
    # sync with, your dev or your production/live site.

l_upload_dir=wp-content/uploads/
r_upload_dir=wp-content/uploads/

    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # uploads directories
    # $l_upload_dir and $r_upload_dir represent where your site's 'uploads' folder is
    # located. This tells rsync which directories on your FTP should be
    # synchronized. If you're using WP-Skeleton
    # <http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/wordpress-skeleton/>, all you
    # have to synchronize is your shared/ folder (content/uploads/ is symlinked to
    # shared/content/uploads/). Otherwise, it's probably wp-content/uploads/.
    # Remember to add a trailing slash.
    # ---------------------------------------------------------

no_drop= # set to true if your host sucks

    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # `drop database` work-around
    # Some servers forbid the `drop database` command (Arvixe, I'm looking at you.)
    # Fortunately, there is an alternate mysql command we can issue to drop all the
    # tables in a database. By setting $no_drop to "true", the script will invoke
    # that command instead of the standard `drop`. Leave blank for default
    # behavior.

    # Custom binaries (local)
    # If you're using MAMP, you need to specify which mysql, mysqldump, and php
    # binaries you want to invoke: MAMP's. This is because, by default, running
    # these from the command line will execute your system defaults (eg.
    # /usr/bin/php or /usr/bin/mysql). Hint: type `which mysql` or whatever to
    # see what your shell is currently defaulting to. If you have manually
    # added MAMP's binaries to your PATH, or if you run your own AMP stack, then
    # leave these variables blank.

auto_update=true

    # ---------------------------------------------------------
    # Auto-Update Flag
    # For the sake of convenience, whenever SyncDB runs it automatically checks for
    # newer versions of itself. If a newer version exists, it prompts the user to
    # download. If you prefer to disable this feature, set auto_update=false or
    # leave it blank.
